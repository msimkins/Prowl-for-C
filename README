Prowl for C (by J. Dijkstra / abort@digitalise.net)
---------------------

This project requires the OpenSSL library and has been tested on Mac OS X (Snow Leopard), Windows XP Professional with SP3 and Debian 5.0.

Feel free to improve the module as there is still plenty of room for improvement (think of things as buffer safety and better XML parsing).

Update in April 2021
---------------------
This example-code is old and was made for times when HTTP/1.0 still was used.
For many years HTTP/1.1 has been in use and now this example-code works again.
